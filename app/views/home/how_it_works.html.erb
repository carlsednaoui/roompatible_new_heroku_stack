<h1>How Roompatible Works</h1>
<div class="row">
    <div class="span16">
<p>Roompatible makes it easy for you to find compatible roommates. You can see how compatible you are with others depending on your compatibility score - also called "Roompatibility". Your Roompatibility ranges from 0% to 100% (100% = roommate soulmates).</p>

        <h2>Why should I log in, you ask?</h2>
	<br />
            <p>When you log in with your Twitter or Facebook account you enable the Roompatible community to see that you are a real person. It is also a good way to keep spammers and creepers away.</p>
            <p>Here are additional reasons why logging in rocks:</p>

<h2>How do you calculate the roommate compatibility score?</h2>
<br />
<p>The score is based on your and others' preferences and interests and involves more math than most people would ever want to know. By allowing Facebook and Twitter only sign-ups we also give you the possibility of seeing that user's public profile - that's right creepers, stay away.</p>
